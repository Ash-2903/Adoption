                    With proper pet grooming, you will get rid of shedding, fleas, ticks, and various health conditions. Proper grooming is more 
                    than just having a cute pet. By grooming your pet, you will also be tackling potentially unhealthy conditions. It will also 
                    allow you to identify any underlying conditions or diseases early. Therefore, you will be able to take your furry friend for 
                    treatment sooner and more efficiently.

        <p>

            How much grooming a dog needs depends on its breed, age, and health. Regular 
                        grooming helps to ensure the dog is healthy and comfortable. Daily grooming decreases chance of various health problems, such as thrush, scratches, and other skin problems.

                    <h3>For Cats</h3>
                    <p>By nature, cats are well equipped to groom themselves. 
                        Cats groom themselves to try to rid of any scents that may let other animals know they are around. Grooming also helps distribute their natural oils to make their fur shiny and clean. 
                        One of the great advantages of grooming at is that we make it completely stress-free.
