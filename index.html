        <p class="text">
            Pet adoption is the process of transferring responsibility for a pet that was previously owned by another party such as a person, shelter or rescue organization.
            Animals are capable of giving us a lifetime of unconditional love without expecting anything in return. The status, abandoned and rescued animals are desperately searching for the tiniest but of compassion and kindness after all the sufferings and hardships they've been through.
            A little bit of love and space in your house will save their lives and give these innocent animals a wonderful chance at life, and they will give you unimaginable happiness in return for your kind deed.
            Our online pet adoption site has databases of pets being housed by thousands of animal shelters and rescue groups, and are searchable by the public.

        <h1 class="sub-headings">Why</h1>
        <p class="text">
            By choosing to adopt an animal from the shelter, you will be saving them from fear, distress, and death.
            Adopt, don’t shop! Unethical breeders and pet shops are a no-go as most breeding practices in India are extremely immoral and cruel. A lot of the ‘pedigree’ puppies and kittens you come across will be a result of mass breeding or backyard breeding. These animals are mercilessly abused and forced to reproduce by breeders who treat them and their litters as nothing more than tools to make money.
            By choosing to adopt from a shelter, not only will you be fighting back against animal cruelty, you will also be saving a life that is dire need and desperately waiting for someone’s help.
            Adopting from a shelter would be a great choice for anyone, especially If you are a first-time pet parent or have little experience with animals. This is because shelters will guide you through the process and will also provide you with all the information you need, making it easier for you to take care of your adopted pet.
